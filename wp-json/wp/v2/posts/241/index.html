This paste can lighten the color deep in your teeth by about one shade.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Whitening strips<\/strong><br \/>\nWhitening strips are thin, clear products that are virtually invisible. They are coated with peroxide-based gel and they should be worn twice a day for 30 minutes each time. The kit should last about two weeks and you should begin to see results within three or four days. The final results should remain for about four months.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Whitening gel<\/strong><br \/>\nWhitening gel is a clear, peroxide-based product that is applied directly to your teeth with a small brush. Each product will have specific instructions for the best results possible, so make sure you follow those instructions so you keep your smile safe and protected.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Whitening mouthwash<\/strong><br \/>\nWhitening mouthwash can freshen your breath, prevent plaque growth, and brightening your smile.
