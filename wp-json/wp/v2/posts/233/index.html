There are a variety of methods to reach a mouth that feels fresh and clean.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brush and floss more frequently.<br \/>\n<\/strong>The plaque that builds up on your teeth collects the bacteria that causes bad breath. Be sure to brush your teeth twice a day and floss once a day to avoid bad breath. If you want fresher breath, do both more often.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Rinse out your mouth.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Mouthwash freshens the breath and adds protection by getting rid of bacteria. Make sure that the mouthwash you choose kills the germs that cause bad breath. Swishing your mouth with water after meals can also help your breath, as it gets rid of food particles that get stuck in the teeth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Brush or scrape your tongue.<br \/>\n<\/strong>The tongue collects bacteria that causes bad breath. Brush your tongue with your toothbrush to get rid of the bacteria. If your toothbrush is too big to reach the back of your tongue, try using a tongue scraper.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Avoid foods and beverages that cause bad breath.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Several foods and beverages cause bad breath, including:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Onions<br \/>\n\u2022 Garlic<br \/>\n\u2022 Cheese<br \/>\n\u2022 Pastrami<br \/>\n\u2022 Certain spices<br \/>\n\u2022 Orange juice<br \/>\n\u2022 Soda<br \/>\n\u2022 Alcohol<\/p>\n<p>Brushing after you eat these foods doesn\u2019t help, as the foods are absorbed into the bloodstream and move to the lungs. Bad breath will last until the culprit has left the body. So, to avoid bad breath, don\u2019t eat these foods\u2014or at least avoid them before going to see friends.<\/p>\n<p><strong>See your dentist or doctor.<br \/>\n<\/strong>Gum disease and tooth decay cause bad breath. Our dentist can recommend treatment to correct these issues. You may also need to visit your doctor to see if there are any underlying medical reasons for the halitosis.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Do you suffer from bad breath?
