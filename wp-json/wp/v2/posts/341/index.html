If you\u2019re one of these people, our dentist, Dr. Clayton M. Hansen, is here to help you. In order to give you the answers you need, he is happy to provide the answers to commonly asked questions about tooth decay in American Fork, Utah.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What causes a cavity?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plaque is the number one cause of cavities. Plaque is the white, nearly invisible film that clings to the teeth and harms the enamel. It usually develops when bacteria collect the sugars and carbohydrates from the foods you eat and then turn them into acid plaque. If your teeth aren\u2019t strong enough to resist the threats, cavities can be created.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are the ways to treat a cavity?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the cavity is small and simple, a dental filling can be used. If the cavity is more complex, a dental crown can be used. If the cavity has infected the internal structures of the tooth, a root canal treatment can be used. Lastly, if the decay has affected and destroyed the majority of the tooth, tooth extraction is necessary.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What happens if I don\u2019t get a cavity treated quickly?<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referring to the second question, major consequences could occur if you do not treat a cavity when you first notice it. In fact, you would suffer severe pain and need more invasive dental treatments as the cavity continues to grow and spread. Ignoring a cavity could also result in the complete loss of the tooth. Lastly, the cavity could affect more than one tooth, especially if the cavity is in a crevice of your smile (between two teeth).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call American Fork Family Dentist at 801-756-2809 today if you have additional questions that weren\u2019t included on this page.
