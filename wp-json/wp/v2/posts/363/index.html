You need not worry. A root canal is used to help you when the pulp of your teeth become infected so you can save your teeth without having to take them out.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of a root canal is to remove decay and infection inside a tooth. If the pulp, the inside, of a tooth gets infected and starts dying, a root canal can resolve the issue without having to completely remove the tooth.<\/p>\n<p>As with most modern dental procedures, the tooth is anesthetized. As such, you should not feel discomfort while work being done.<\/p>\n<p>Once the anesthesia has taken effect, the dentist will need to create an opening to reach the tooth pulp. Once inside, the dentist will use small tools to take the infected portions of the pulp out.<\/p>\n<p>Once the infected pulp is removed, the dentist will fill in the opening. This filling should protect the pulp from getting infected again and give strength back to its structure. If extra support is needed, a rod may be placed into the canal to keep things sturdy.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on how far the infection went, you may or may not need a crown, a fake tooth that goes over the treated tooth to restore function and provide further defense. If the damage was extensive enough, the crown may be required. If damage was light, you may not need it.<\/p>\n<p>Once that is done, you may take a few days to adjust to the change in your tooth, but you should be able to get back to normal life. If any problems do continue, do not hesitate to come back.<\/p>\n<p>You can come to American Fork Family Dentist in American Fork, Utah to learn more and receive treatment. Dr. Clayton M. Hansen will do all he can so you can feel comfortable and get the treatment you need.
