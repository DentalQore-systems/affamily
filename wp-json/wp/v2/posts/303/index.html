Hansen may suggest a crown if your tooth is weak, or needs to be held together, or because the tooth is broken or severely worn down. The doctor may also recommend a crown to help hold a bridge in place, or to protect a tooth that has had a root canal. Crowns might also be used to cover up a dental implant or a discolored tooth. Crowns can be made from metal, porcelain, or resin. They may also be ceramic, or they can be made from a combination of materials. <\/p>\n<p>Normally, two visits to American Fork Family Dentist in American Fork, Utah are needed for a crown. During your first visit, we\u2019ll take x-rays of the tooth, and if necessary we\u2019ll remove any decay or pulp. Then we may file the tooth down to make room for your new crown. When we have finished that, we will make an impression of the tooth to create your new crown.<\/p>\n<p>It can take up to two weeks to make a crown at the lab, and during that time you will have a temporary crown that will be put in by Dr. Hansen. The permanent crown will be put in on the second visit. <\/p>\n<p>A crown will last between 5 and 15 years with proper care and good oral hygiene. You will still need to brush, floss, and visit us for regular examinations and cleanings. If you have a tooth that might need a crown, please call us today at 801-756-2809 to schedule an appointment. Together, we will come up with the best treatment plan for you.  <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Dr. Clayton M.
