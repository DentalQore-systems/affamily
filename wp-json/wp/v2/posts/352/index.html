Using the techniques you employ to effectively floss your teeth can often be the difference between good oral health and great oral health. Listed below are a few helpful steps to remember to keep your smile safe:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 1:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Look for a dental floss that is shred resistant, and will not tear easily. As an alternative, consider using an interdental cleaner such as a water flosser to clean between teeth. For additional help, contact your dentist for product recommendations and suggestions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 2:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you decide on threaded floss, use a strand that is roughly 18\u201d in length. Wrap one end of the floss around a finger on each hand. Move up and down the strand as necessary when flossing and never use the same section more than once.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 3:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Focus on flossing between every one of your teeth and the back row. A standard flossing session should take between 2 to 3 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 4:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Once you are done effectively flossing between every tooth, discard of the strand of dental floss and use a new one with each subsequent use.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 5:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Rinse your mouth out with water or safe mouthwash to remove any residue that may linger behind on your teeth and gums.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 6:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Repeat steps 1 through 5 on a daily basis to ensure your mouth remains clean.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you ready to upgrade and enhance your smile with safe and efficient oral health care treatments?
