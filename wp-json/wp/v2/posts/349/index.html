This could include dental crowns, dental bridges, and porcelain dental veneers. While they are created from durable dental materials that often rival the strength of natural tooth enamel, it is still possible for a piece of dental work to be chipped or fractured.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is even more likely to occur if you have a bad habit of nibbling on objects, opening packages with your teeth, or chewing on ice. Even if the damage to your dental work seems minimal, you should still have it examined by a professional dentist like Dr. Clayton M. Hansen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If some form of dental trauma has left blood or unwanted debris in your mouth, you can gently rinse it away with lukewarm saltwater. Dr. Hansen and his highly trained staff will handle any other necessary cleaning measures.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the internal structures of the tooth have also been traumatized Dr. Hansen might need to perform endodontic therapy.
