Well, it\u2019s true! If you would like a smile you can be proud of then keep reading! Our practice at American Fork Family Dentist in American Fork, Utah, is proud to offer dental veneers, which is why we are providing you with this basic information on them.<\/p>\n<p>Dental veneers are a new form of cosmetic dentistry, that has been extremely successful. Dental veneers are custom-made shells that bond to the front of each individual tooth. These shells are wafer thin and appear as if they are your natural tooth, so no one knows otherwise except you and your dentist.<\/p>\n<p>Dental veneers are also durable and with proper care, they can last up to ten years! Because veneers are not made of the same enamel your teeth are made from, they are not subject to tooth decay, but the tooth behind your dental veneer is, which means brushing and flossing are still important to do each day.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any flaws in your smile you wish to hide, or just simply want a consultation with Dr. Clayton M. Hansen, please call us today at 801-756-2809 to set up an appointment. Our friendly staff is dedicated when it comes to helping you have a smile that is healthy, and a smile you can enjoy and be proud of when it shines!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Did you know, you can correct flaws in your teeth with dental veneers?
