Hansen may recommend a dental bridge in American Fork, Utah. A bridge consists of a replacement tooth (pontic) attached to two adjacent crowns which together form a structure that is bonded into the mouth. The crowns are placed over the teeth on either side of the gap. These teeth are called the abutment teeth. Failure to replace missing teeth can cause teeth to shift, leading to malocclusion (bad bite), misaligned teeth, and jaw problems.<\/p>\n<p>There are three main kinds of dental bridges: traditional bridges, cantilever bridges, and Maryland bonded bridges. Traditional bridges, which are made from porcelain fused to metal or ceramics, are the most common type of bridge. They consist of a crown for each abutment tooth with a false tooth in between. Cantilever bridges are used when there is only an adjacent tooth on one side of the gap. These bridges are not common anymore. Maryland bonded bridges consist of porcelain, porcelain-fused-to-metal, or plastic teeth and gums that are supported by a metal or porcelain framework. The framework has wings on either side of the dental bridge that is bonded to your teeth.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more and to schedule your next appointment with our dentist, contact our dental office today.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"myvisualtutor singlevideo singlevideo-7\" src=\"https:\/\/media.dentalqore.com\/media\/7\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"When a patient is missing a permanent tooth, Dr. Clayton M.
