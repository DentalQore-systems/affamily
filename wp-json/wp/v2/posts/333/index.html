If tooth decay has eroded your enamel, a hole may have appeared in one of your teeth called a cavity. In order to prevent infection and tooth loss, the cavity must be mended with a dental filling &#8211; either a dental amalgam or tooth-colored compound. Here are some facts about the two main types of dental fillings:<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Dental amalgams are a combination of metals that leave a distinct metallic shine. Composite fillings are a combination of clearer ingredients that leave a tooth-colored shine.<br \/>\n&#8211; The bigger a cavity is, the more likelihood there is of requiring a dental amalgam. Composite fillings tend to work best only for small to medium-sized cavities.<br \/>\n&#8211; Only dental amalgams require removal when replacing them. New composite fillings can be coated directly over the originals.<br \/>\n&#8211; If you are allergic to mercury, avoid dental amalgams, as mercury is used as a binding agent.<\/p>\n<p>No matter the dental filling treatment you desire, Dr. Clayton M. Hansen and our team at American Fork Family Dentist are here to offer you the smile you want.
