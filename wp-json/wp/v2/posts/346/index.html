Our dentist and team will gladly speak with you and help you determine if veneers are the right choice for you. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Whiten Your Smile<\/strong><br \/>\nIf your teeth become stained or yellowed, teeth whitening is an option, but the teeth can darken again. If you would like to brighten your smile for good, veneers might be for you. Veneers are stain resistant, so they won\u2019t darken or yellow. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Fix Minor Smile Imperfections<\/strong><br \/>\nVeneers can aid those with slightly crooked or gapped teeth. Since veneers are attached to the front of teeth, they can cover minor orthodontic issues even though they do not actually change the position of the teeth. Veneers can also repair minor smile imperfections like chipped teeth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Strengthen Teeth With Eroded or Damaged Enamel<\/strong><br \/>\nEven though tooth enamel is strong, it is not indestructible. Enamel can be weakened by vigorous brushing or by highly acidic foods and drinks. In addition, the enamel can become cracked. Having veneers placed can strengthen the teeth with damaged or eroded enamel.<\/p>\n<p>Please contact our office at 801-756-2809 today to learn more about veneers and to schedule your next visit.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Do you have smile imperfections like cracked, stained, or misshapen teeth?
