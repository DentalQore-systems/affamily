Hansen and our team are more than happy to tell you!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oral hygiene is the best way to keep your smile in tip-top shape. However, it\u2019s only effective if you have the proper techniques. So, to help you take great care of your teeth and gums on a regular basis, we recommend doing the following things:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Brush<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Brush your teeth twice a day\u2014every morning and every night\u2014for two minutes each time. As you do so, please use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste. It\u2019s also important to scrub each quadrant of your smile for the same amount of time\u2014that way each tooth will receive the same cleaning job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Floss<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Floss the crevices of your mouth with a flossing product of your choice. Make sure you scrape the sides of each tooth and you are gentle along the gumline as you do so. Flossing is a great way to remove the plaque and food particles in your smile. Make sure you floss once a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Rinse<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Rinse your mouth daily with antibacterial or fluoride mouthwash. Doing so will complete the cleaning job and will nourish and strengthen your smile. Follow the instructions on the bottle and make sure to rinse after you\u2019ve brushed and flossed your teeth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Visit your dentist<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: See your dentist every six months for a routine cleaning and checkup. These appointments are extremely important because they include treatments that can completely remove the plaque from your smile, which will reduce your chances of falling victim to tooth decay and gum disease.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To learn more about oral hygiene in American Fork, Utah, and its many benefits, please feel free to call 801-756-2809 today and schedule an appointment.
