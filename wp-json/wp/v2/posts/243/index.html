Our team encourages you to preserve the health of your baby\u2019s teeth by preventing Baby Bottle Tooth Decay.<\/p>\n<p>Baby Bottle Tooth Decay, also known as Early Childhood Caries, is tooth decay in infants and toddlers. Its name derives from the most common cause: baby bottles.<\/p>\n<p>Bottles and sippy cups encourage prolonged exposure of your baby\u2019s teeth to liquid. If that liquid contains a high amount of sugar\u2014as is the case with soda, fruit juice and even milk\u2014your child\u2019s risk of tooth decay increases significantly. <\/p>\n<p>The ADA recommends restricting sugary drinks to meal and snack times, when your child will drink rapidly. Going to bed with a sugary drink allows the sugar to remain on the teeth all night, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. If your child insists on taking a bottle to bed, water is the best option, as it contains zero sugar.<\/p>\n<p>Tooth decay can also spread from you to your child through shared saliva. If you clean a bottle or pacifier by sticking it in your mouth, bacteria will transfer to your child. Always clean bottles and pacifiers with warm water and soap before giving either to your child.<\/p>\n<p>For more information on Baby Bottle Tooth Decay, contact American Fork Family Dentist at 801-756-2809.
