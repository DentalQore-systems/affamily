Hansen provides and educates our patients about preventive care in American Fork, Utah. Medical research continues to show us the strong connection between good oral health and overall health. Our dentist recommends that you practice good oral hygiene and that you visit us every six months for a routine dental checkup.<\/p>\n<p>Good oral hygiene practices include brushing your teeth thoroughly twice a day and flossing once a day. Use fluoride toothpaste and replace your toothbrush every three to four months. When you floss, be sure to gently slide the floss under your gum line. Move the floss up and down several times to scrape off plaque.<\/p>\n<p>Your routine dental checkup will include a professional teeth cleaning, fluoride, a dental exam, and dental X-rays. Our hygienist will clean your teeth of plaque and tartar. Our hygienist will then floss your teeth, polish them, and apply fluoride. Fluoride is a mineral that helps protect your teeth from decay. By doing a comprehensive exam, we can work together as a team to develop a plan for achieving and maintaining long-term health. As part of your comprehensive exam, we will screen for oral cancer as well as examine the teeth and supporting tissues. We will review your medical and dental history, so remember to bring a list of any medications you are taking. Sometimes, our dentist will perform dental X-rays to get a closer, more thorough look at your smile.<\/p>\n<p>Please contact our dental office today to learn more and to schedule a visit.<\/p>\n<p><!-- mediamed.com video: PROPHY.mp4 --><br \/>\n<div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"myvisualtutor singlevideo singlevideo-57\" src=\"https:\/\/media.dentalqore.com\/media\/57\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Dr. Clayton M.
