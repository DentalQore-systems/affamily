Hansen may recommend dental implants in American Fork, Utah. Dental implants are a good option for replacing missing teeth without relying on other teeth for support. An implant replaces a missing tooth with a titanium screw which supports a dental crown, dental bridge, or denture. Implants are a conservative way to regain the natural look and function of missing teeth.<\/p>\n<p>Dental implants have many benefits. The product looks and feels like your own teeth and it restores the beauty and functionality of your smile. Dental implants are designed to fuse with your jawbone, so they become a permanent part of your smile. Unlike dental bridges, dental implants do not require tooth reduction. Because of this, your long-term oral health is improved. Dental implants are very durable and will last for many years, or even a lifetime. Implants have several advantages over dentures. Dentures can slide in your mouth, making eating and speaking difficult. Implants are a part of you, so you will be able to eat and speak properly. Implants are more comfortable and convenient than dentures because they are not removable, but instead are a part of your smile.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to contact our dental office today to learn more and to schedule your next appointment with our dentist.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"myvisualtutor singlevideo singlevideo-9\" src=\"https:\/\/media.dentalqore.com\/media\/9\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"If you are missing one or more permanent teeth, Dr. Clayton M.
