But today, we would like to shift the focus by teaching you that some foods are good for your dental health.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Foods to Help Your Teeth:<\/strong><br \/>\n-Dairy Products: Milk can help you have strong bones, but dairy products may be able to do so much more for your oral health. Cheeses can lower the acid levels in your mouth and help you fight off cavities, all while promoting an increase in saliva production.<br \/>\n-Sugar-free Gum: The xylitol in sugar-free gum and candies can help prevent tooth decay and promote saliva production.<br \/>\n-Nuts and Seeds: These can provide a great source of calcium and protein for your smile. You can eat them on their own, together or put them in a salad or other foods for a meal or snack. Some examples are almonds, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, cashews, pecans and sunflower seeds.<br \/>\n-Fruits and Vegetables: Carrots, celery, apples etc. can promote saliva production in your mouth and may have other benefits as well. Apples have been called \u201cnature\u2019s toothbrush,\u201d but they should not replace your regular brushing routine. Kale, and other leafy greens, can be rich in calcium that can strengthen the enamel on your teeth.<\/p>\n<p>For more information regarding teeth-friendly foods, or to schedule an appointment with Dr. Clayton M. Hansen, please give our team a call at 801-756-2809.
