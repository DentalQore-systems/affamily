When selecting your tooth whitening treatment, choose wisely! Some products simply do not live up their billing and cannot produce their intended results. With the help of our team at American Fork Family Dentist, we can point you in the right direction to accommodate whatever your oral health care needs are. Here are some important FAQs to consider about teeth whitening treatments:<\/p>\n<p>What are the most common teeth whitening treatment options?<br \/>\n&#8211; In-office professional treatments are often thought of as the best quality teeth whitening treatments available, as they are safe, customized to your dental profile, and administered directly by licensed professionals. At-home products distributed by your dentist are also of extremely high quality and safety. Over-the-counter products are unregulated and some can be potentially harmful to your teeth and gums. Always speak with an oral health care provider before using store-bought treatments.<\/p>\n<p>TRUE or FALSE: Teeth whitening treatments fortify teeth.<br \/>\n&#8211; This is false. Teeth whitening treatments are used to annihilate stains and improve discoloration issues. Teeth whitening products should never be used to enhance your oral hygiene or as a substitute to brushing or flossing. <\/p>\n<p>What are the benefits of enhancing the color of your teeth?<br \/>\n&#8211; With teeth whitening treatments, you can improve the shade color of your teeth, eliminate stains, enhance your feeling of self-worth and self-esteem, and make you more socially acceptable by potential employers, friends, and your peers.<\/p>\n<p>If you would like a professional tooth whitening treatment from American Fork Family Dentist at our dentist office in American Fork, Utah, please contact us at 801-756-2809.
