If you wish to change the color, shape, size, or length of your teeth, Dr. Clayton M. Hansen may recommend dental veneers in American Fork, Utah. Dental veneers, which are made from porcelain or from resin composite materials, can be used to fix the following smile imperfections:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stained teeth<\/li>\n<li>Worn down teeth<\/li>\n<li>Chipped, cracked, or broken teeth<\/li>\n<li>Slightly crooked or crowded teeth<\/li>\n<li>Misshapen teeth<\/li>\n<li>Gaps and spaces between teeth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When placing a dental veneer, our dentist will first remove a small amount of enamel from the tooth to allow room for the veneer in your mouth. Impressions will then be taken of your tooth so that a dental veneer can be constructed. A shade of material will be selected that will closely match the color of your natural teeth, or that will lighten the shade of your tooth. When the veneer is ready, our dentist will temporarily place the veneer on the tooth to check its fit and color. Adjustments will be made as necessary and then our dentist will permanently cement the veneer in place.<\/p>\n<p>To learn more, contact our dental office and schedule a consultation today.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"myvisualtutor singlevideo singlevideo-10\" src=\"https:\/\/media.dentalqore.com\/media\/10\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Dental veneers are thin coverings that are custom made to cover the front of your teeth to improve their appearance.
