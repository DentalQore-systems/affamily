Hansen, will not be subject to tooth decay, they will still need basic cleaning and maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that each dental veneer is only cemented to the face of a tooth. The rest of the enamel and the internal structures of the tooth remain unchanged. This means that you will need to diligently brush and floss each tooth to keep it healthy and strong.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting that your natural tooth enamel is significantly harder than the porcelain veneer. So, try to get into the habit of cutting hard foods into small pieces and popping them into your mouth.<\/p>\n<p>The porcelain material that makes up the veneers will only be receptive to minor surface staining. Your natural tooth enamel is far more receptive to stains. If you enjoy dark foods and beverages or if you use tobacco, your teeth could develop contrasting and noticeable stains.<\/p>\n<p>If you have questions about the best way to maintain your new porcelain dental veneers in American Fork, Utah, you can call American Fork Family Dentist at 801-756-2809 for a consultation. We look forward to helping you maintain your white and winning smile!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Even though the dental veneers that were installed by your dentist, Dr. Clayton M.
