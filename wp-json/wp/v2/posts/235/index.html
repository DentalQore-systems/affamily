To help you do that, we\u2019re happy to dispel some of the more common misconceptions to help you keep your smile safe.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, have you ever heard that its normal for your gums to bleed while you\u2019re flossing? In reality, if your gums are bleeding you could already be suffering with gum disease\u2014and it could lead to more serious problems. You see, when your gums are inflamed, bacteria and germs can enter your bloodstream through your mouth and eventually spread throughout your body. If this happens, you could be in danger of heart disease, arthritis, and stroke.<\/p>\n<p>Still, have you been told that it\u2019s fairly rare? Sadly, gum disease is actually fairly common. Sadly, this isn\u2019t true. In fact, nearly half of Americans over thirty have some form of gum disease and not know it. Sadly, gum disease can be difficult to detect. We recommend visiting Dr. Clayton M. Hansen once every six months for a checkup. Our team will be able to detect gum disease and help you address the issue.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in learning more, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us at 801-756-2809 soon.
