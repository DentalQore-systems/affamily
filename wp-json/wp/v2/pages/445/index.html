The laser&#8217;s cutting speed and other functions can be managed using a foot pedal and computer controls, allowing our dentist to stay in control during the procedure and maintain precision and accuracy. Due to this enhanced accuracy, your procedure completed with the Solea laser can be anesthesia-, blood-, suture- and pain-free.<\/p>\n<p>Benefits of the Solea laser include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enhanced comfort<\/strong> \u2013 Anesthesia is often not needed for procedures performed with the Solea laser.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Faster treatment<\/strong> \u2013 The advanced wavelength allows quicker and even quieter treatment than other lasers or manual tools provide.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Greater precision<\/strong> \u2013 Our dentist and team have improved control of the Solea laser over other lasers or manual tools, enhancing the accuracy of treatment and results.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Multi-quadrant treatment<\/strong> \u2013 Due to the Solea&#8217;s laser speed and efficiency, our dentist can treat all affected areas of your mouth in just one visit, meaning you do not need to return for multiple visits to target one specific area of the mouth each time.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><iframe width=\"\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3tLuVLpx_Ks\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h3>Aerosol &#038; Splatter Reduction<\/h3>\n<p>According to multiple lab studies, the Solea laser can reduce the amount of aerosols and splatter from dental procedures by up to 99.9%, making it a much safer and cleaner alternative over traditional dental handpieces. Because the Solea laser uses less water flow and air pressure and makes incisions without any contact, the aerosol production is decreased, which means you and our team members are breathing in fewer droplets, lessening the spread of bacteria or viruses.<\/p>\n<h3>No Live Pathogens in Solea Splatter<\/h3>\n<p>Live bacteria in generated Solea mist is reduced by 96% compared to traditional dental drills, according to an in vitro study. The transmission of viable pathogens is therefore reduced in Solea splatter, decreasing the likelihood of disease or bacterial spread.<\/p>\n<p>We are committed to making your dental experience with our team a positive and comfortable one!
