Gingivitis is caused by the growth or bacteria on your teeth, above and below the gum line. If left untreated, gum disease can cause the loss of permanent teeth. This disease is usually painless, so you may not know you have it. However, if you experience any of the following symptoms, Dr. Clayton M. Hansen may treat gingivitis in American Fork, Utah:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Red, swollen, and sore gums<\/li>\n<li>Gums that bleed easily when you brush and floss<\/li>\n<li>Receding gums<\/li>\n<li>The formation of pockets between your gums and teeth<\/li>\n<li>Persistent bad breath<\/li>\n<li>Pus coming from the gums<\/li>\n<li>A change in your bite<\/li>\n<li>Loose permanent teeth<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you have gingivitis, our dentist may recommend extra teeth cleaning appointments. Our hygienist will clean your teeth of all plaque and tartar. If this is not sufficient, our dentist may suggest a deep cleaning procedure called scaling and root planing. Our dentist will clean all of the plaque and tartar from your teeth, above and below the gum line. Then, rough spots on your tooth roots will be smoothed, making it difficult for plaque to adhere to them.<\/p>\n<p>We invite you to contact our dental office today to learn more and to schedule your next appointment.<\/p>\n<p><!-- mediamed.com video: SRP.mp4 --><\/p>\n<p><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"myvisualtutor singlevideo singlevideo-47\" src=\"https:\/\/media.dentalqore.com\/media\/47\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Gum disease, which is also called gingivitis, is an infection that attacks the tissues and bones that surround and support your teeth.
