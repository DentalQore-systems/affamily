Hansen may place a dental filling in American Fork, Utah. Our dentist will remove the decay from the tooth and then fill the area with a filling material. Our dental office provides amalgam fillings and composite resin fillings.<\/p>\n<p>Amalgam fillings are made of mercury, silver, tin, zinc, and copper. Amalgam fillings, also known as silver fillings, are very durable, lasting for at least 10 to 15 years. Silver fillings usually outlast composite fillings. Amalgams are strong and can withstand the chewing forces in your mouth. Amalgam fillings are less expensive than composite fillings. Composite fillings, also known as tooth-colored fillings, can be made to closely match the color of your natural teeth. Defective, leaking, or \u201cugly\u201d fillings can be replaced with these modern, tooth-colored materials. These materials have a natural appearance, do not cause sensitivity to temperatures, and are mercury free. Composite fillings are chemically bonded to your tooth structure, so they have extra support. Tooth-colored fillings are versatile, as they can also be used to repair chipped, cracked, broken, or worn down teeth. Consult with our dentist to determine which filling material is right for you.<\/p>\n<p>We encourage you to contact our dental office today to learn more and to schedule your next appointment.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"myvisualtutor singlevideo singlevideo-8\" src=\"https:\/\/media.dentalqore.com\/media\/8\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"When a patient has a cavity, Dr. Clayton M.
