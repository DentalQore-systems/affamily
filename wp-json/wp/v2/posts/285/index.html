When an oral accident occurs, make sure to stay calm and prepare a plan to minimize the damage. In many cases, bleeding may occur so it\u2019s important if there is an open wound to keep it clean so an infection does not occur.<\/p>\n<p>If you get an object stuck in your mouth, it\u2019s probably going to occur between the teeth. Never use a sharp object to try and dislodge the object. Be careful not to use anything that can chip or crack your teeth. Your best options are interdental cleaners, especially dental floss.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes when we are eating or speaking, we can bite our lips or tongue. Although most bites are small, sometimes we can break the surface of the skin. If you are bleeding, wash the wound out immediately to ensure it is clean. After it is clean, apply a fresh gauze pad to stop the bleeding. After the bleeding stops, make sure the wound does not require stitches. If it does, visit your doctor. The same treatment should be used for cracked or broken teeth.<\/p>\n<p>There are many activities or risks in our world that can cause immediate tooth loss. Always protect yourself with safety equipment if possible, especially during contact sports. If you do have any teeth knocked out, there could still be a chance to save it. Keep the tooth moist at all times so it doesn\u2019t dry out. This includes storing it in milk, salt water, or an approved tooth-saver product. Take the tooth back to your dentist to see if reinsertion is possible.<\/p>\n<p>If you suffer an oral accident, always call American Fork Family Dentist as soon as possible. To contact us, simply call 801-756-2809. You can also call us to schedule an appointment at our dentist office in American Fork, Utah. Dr. Clayton M.
