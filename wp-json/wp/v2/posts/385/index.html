Our team is happy to review both versions for optimal tooth replacement to help you better understand how they can restore your smile. Below we will review the main types of dentures, which are full and partial dentures, and the benefits they have to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Dentures replace missing teeth in your smile to keep other teeth from changing their position. Dentures are customized for your mouth to fit comfortably and can be removed for cleaning. Today&#8217;s dentures are more natural-looking than ever so that your appearance and smile remain natural. Without dentures, missing teeth can cause the facial muscles to droop and you may appear to age prematurely. Dentures also help you chew comfortably and speak clearly again when they restore missing teeth in your smile.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Full Dentures<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Full dentures are designed to offer full tooth replacement by filling a full arch of missing teeth with a beautiful and natural-looking appliance. To place full dentures, it may be necessary to perform a tooth extraction to make space for this appliance if there are still teeth lingering in your smile. The conventional denture is made after your teeth have been extracted and after the gum tissue has started healing. These are typically ready to be worn about eight to 12 weeks after your teeth are removed. Your oral appliance is placed over your gums and held securely using suction to attach to the roof of your mouth. Full dentures are removable and can be taken out at night and for cleanings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Partial Dentures<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you have a few missing teeth in a row, partial dentures can restore your beautiful smile. This removable oral appliance is used to fill the gap from missing teeth so that you can have a beautiful and functional smile again. These partial appliances clasp to the neighboring teeth in your smile to help you speak, smile and chew properly. These replacement teeth are attached to a colored plastic base that looks like your natural gums. If you have a fixed bridge to replace one or more of your teeth, crowns are placed on the teeth that border the space with artificial teeth and are cemented into place.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to full and partial dentures, there is a third option for some. Implant-supported dentures are an overdenture which is attached to dental implants for support and are most often made for the lower jaw. These are often done if there are no teeth in the jaw but there is sufficient jaw bone material to support implants. These have special attachments that snap them onto the implant.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which type of denture you wear, you want to take good care of your oral health to keep your gum tissue healthy by practicing good oral hygiene habits. You will also want to make sure you see our dentist regularly to make sure your dentures fit correctly and ensure they are comfortable and that your gums are healthy.<\/p>\n<p>Both full and partial dentures can be very functional and make excellent choices when it comes to tooth loss and tooth replacement.
