For a stronger and healthier smile, we recommend cleaning your teeth during the day while you are at work. To make that possible and to help you properly do so, we recommend doing the following things:<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         Keep a soft-bristled toothbrush at your desk so you can brush your smile any time you feel it\u2019s necessary. We also recommend keeping floss with you as well. It might even be easier to have a flossing tool handy so you can floss and work at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         Do your best to brush your teeth immediately after lunch\u2014before you answer emails and before you start working. If you make this task a priority, your teeth will remain healthy and you won\u2019t need to worry about having food stuck in your smile.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         After you brush, dry your toothbrush and put it in a sanitary travel container. You need to keep your toothbrush as clean as possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u00b7         Replace your toothbrush more often than you replace your home toothbrush. It\u2019s best to do so because the office tends to have more bacteria and germs that can reside on your toothbrush.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Clayton M. Hansen and our dental team care for you and your smile, and we are excited to see you accomplish your smile goals! If you have any questions or if you would like additional tips, we encourage you to call 801-756-2809 and talk to a member of our team during office hours.
