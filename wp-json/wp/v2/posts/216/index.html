Cross-contamination between brushes is never a good idea when it comes to your dental health.<\/p>\n<p>Never lend your toothbrush to someone else or use another toothbrush that isn\u2019t yours. This can expose you or someone else to harmful bacteria that could make either of you sick.<\/p>\n<p>Keep your toothbrush in open air rather than in a closed container.<\/p>\n<p>Replace your toothbrush every three to four months to ensure the bristles of your toothbrush are working effectively.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to visit your dentist every six months for dental cleanings!
