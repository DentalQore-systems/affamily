Dr. Clayton M. Hansen and our team want to give you a quick overview of how important fluoride is to a healthy smile.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why Fluoride?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Because dental caries (cavities) are the most common disease in both adults and children, around the globe, and fluoride is one of the most effective ways to prevent cavities. Fluoride is a mineral that makes your teeth stronger and more resistant to the harmful effects of acid. This acid results from bacteria in the mouth feeding off sugars from the food and drinks we consume, and this acid wears down tooth enamel.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tap Water Beats Bottled Water<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Although all water beats soda, sports drinks, and even sweetened fruit juice when it comes to hydrating without contributing to cavities, most bottled water doesn\u2019t have fluoride in it. Tap water which has added fluoride in the water supply contains just the right amount, thanks to the standards set by the EPA. Essentially, drinking water with fluoride helps keep cavities at bay before they start.<\/p>\n<p>Other sources of fluoride include toothpaste (use the recommended amount and spit it out when done), and your dentist\u2019s fluoride treatment, which is a thin layer of varnish applied to your teeth.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fun Fact<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thanks to fluoride\u2019s proven track record of preventing cavities, fluoride in tap water was lauded as a top public health achievement in the 20<sup>th<\/sup> century, in the CDC&#8217;s (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) <em>Ten Great Public Health Achievements in the 20<sup>th<\/sup> Century.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>If you have any questions regarding your oral health, or to learn more about how fluoride can help you, please give our team a call at 801-756-2809 today.
