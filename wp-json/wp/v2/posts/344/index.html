It helps strengthen your enamel, which in turn protects the soft inner layers of your teeth&#8211;the dentin and pulp&#8211; from decay and cavities.<\/p>\n<p>To get their suggested daily dose of calcium, many people turn to dairy, as these foods are typically outstanding sources of calcium. But if you are lactose intolerant and can\u2019t have most dairy, how can you get the needed daily dose (1,000-2,000mg per day)? Did you know there are also many non-dairy foods with calcium? Here are some options to consider:<\/p>\n<p>Dark Leafy Greens: Collard greens, spinach, and kale are all wonderful sources of calcium. Not to mention they have low calories, high fiber content, and are packed with vitamins. Try them in a green smoothie for an energizing beverage option.<\/p>\n<p>Fortified Foods: Some kinds of tofu, orange juice, even breakfast cereals are often fortified with extra added calcium. This is a way to enjoy a variety of foods while still giving your body the calcium it needs to support healthy teeth and gums! Be careful of cereals and juice with a lot of sugar, as the sugar may cancel out the good that calcium does for your teeth. You can have it with a large meal or drink water afterward to help wash away harmful chemicals.<\/p>\n<p>Almonds: Almonds are a yummy way to incorporate calcium in your diet. They contain 246 mg of calcium per cup. They also contain magnesium, vitamin E, fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Almonds are a great snacking option for overall health.<\/p>\n<p>For more ideas about how to take care of your smile in American Fork, Utah, phone us at American Fork Family Dentist. Dr. Clayton M.
