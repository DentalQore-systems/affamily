Many times, an infection is easy to spot because it causes pain, swelling, or sensitivity. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, Dr. Clayton M. Hansen may recommend a root canal in American Fork, Utah. Sometimes the tooth shows no symptoms. Root canal therapy is the process by which our dentist removes infected dental pulp, debris, and bacteria. The dental pulp is the area in the center of a tooth where the veins, nerves, and connective tissues are located.<\/p>\n<p>Our dentist will take an X-ray to examine the shape of your root canals and to see if there is any infection in the surrounding bone. An access hole is drilled into the tooth, through which the dental pulp, bacteria, and debris are removed. Our dentist will use root canal files to clean out your tooth all the way down the roots. Once the tooth is thoroughly cleaned, our dentist will seal it with a sealer paste and a rubber compound. The access hole is closed with a dental filling.<\/p>\n<p>Feel free to contact our dental office today to learn more and to schedule an appointment.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"video-container\"><iframe class=\"myvisualtutor singlevideo singlevideo-15\" src=\"https:\/\/media.dentalqore.com\/media\/15\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-scripts allow-same-origin\"><\/iframe><\/div><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"When a tooth becomes infected either from a cavity or trauma, it is necessary to perform enzootic (root canal) treatment to save the tooth and eliminate the infection.
