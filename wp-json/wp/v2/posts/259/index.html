They hurt, can be costly to fill, and pose a serious threat to your overall oral health. However, preventing them is much easier than treating them.

It\u2019s estimated that 80% of the population doesn\u2019t floss, which is a big reason why so many people have cavities. Flossing just once, usually in the evenings, removes debris, plaque, and food from the places your brush can\u2019t reach.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nBrush twice a day<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to remember to brush your teeth when you wake up in the morning. After all, they don&#8217;t call it morning breath for anything! However, remembering to brush at night, before going to bed, isn\u2019t always the easiest. Brushing twice daily, though, is a surefire way to prevent cavities.<br \/>\n<strong><br \/>\nUse mouthwash<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Mouthwash is a great thing to use, especially after brushing at night. It adds another cleansing layer to your oral health regimen and does an effective job of killing bacteria that your toothpaste may have missed.<\/p>\n<p>If you think you may have cavities on some teeth, or need to schedule your next annual checkup, call us today at 801-756-2809.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"No one wants cavities.
