These fillings can be applied in a single appointment.<\/p>\n<p>Porcelain-ceramic fillings are a good choice for teeth that appear in your smile. The porcelain material can be shaded to match the color of the surrounding tooth enamel. Porcelain fillings are made in a laboratory and then fitted during a follow-up appointment.<\/p>\n<p>The biting surfaces of your back teeth are often used to do a lot of chewing and grinding. This makes durable materials, like gold and base metals, a good choice for fillings in these areas. Just like porcelain fillings, gold inlays and onlays need to be custom made in a dental lab before being cemented into your cavity at a brief follow-up appointment.<\/p>\n<p>Amalgam fillings are less expensive than gold, yet they are just as durable. Amalgam is dark in color so it is rarely used to fill a cavity in a tooth that is visible in your smile.<\/p>\n<p>If you suspect a cavity has formed on one of your teeth, you should not delay in contacting our office at 801-756-2809 to have it examined, treated and repaired with a dental filling in American Fork, Utah.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"Here at American Fork Family Dentist, our team commonly uses fillings to repair small to medium-sized areas of tooth decay.
