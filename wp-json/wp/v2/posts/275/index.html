The concentration of whitening agents he employs represent the safest and most effective way to whiten your smile.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Clayton M. Hansen will start by protecting your gums with a special gel or a rubber dam. A small amount of concentrated dental bleach will then be poured into a mouth tray. This will be held in your mouth for a few minutes to allow the bleach to seep deep into your tooth enamel.  <\/p>\n<p>The total duration of the bleaching treatment will vary depending on the degree of the stains. Afterward, Dr. Clayton M. Hansen might use a special ultraviolet light for additional whitening in textured areas of the tooth enamel. <\/p>\n<p>Once your teeth have had their bright, white luster restored, you might want to cut back on certain dark foods and beverages. It might also help to brush your teeth with a whitening toothpaste to continue to remove surface stains before they get a chance to set in. <\/p>\n<p>If you have significant stains on your teeth, you should contact American Fork Family Dentist at 801-756-2809 to ask about a dental bleaching treatment in American Fork, Utah.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A smile dulled by deep stains can leave you feeling uncomfortable about your appearance.
