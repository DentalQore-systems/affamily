ADA-Sealed brands are sugar free and have been approved by the ADA.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let chewing sugarless gum replace brushing your teeth and flossing. Doing this may result in more plaque buildup, gingivitis and potentially tooth decay and tooth loss. Dentists recommend that patients brush their teeth at least twice per day and floss at least once per day to prevent plaque buildup, but this brushing and flossing should not be replaced by chewing gum.<\/p>\n<p>Chewing gum also helps prevent heartburn. Just as chewing gum prevents cavities by producing saliva while chewing, it does the same for heartburn. The saliva produced makes you swallow more often, pushing acids out. <\/p>\n<p>Next time you want something to chew on, grab a pack of sugar-free gum at the grocery store.
