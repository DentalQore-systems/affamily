If the pulp (the bundle of nerves and blood vessels living inside your teeth) is infected beyond repair, then an extraction is likely your best bet. Additionally, if your tooth is cracked or fractured beyond what bonding or a crown could fix, an extraction then replacement with an implant can restore your tooth\u2019s appearance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Root canal<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A root canal is a procedure that removes the infected part of the pulp inside of your tooth, then covers the top of your tooth with a crown. Root canals are performed on teeth that are deemed salvageable, and they\u2019re a great option if you don\u2019t the tooth extracted or don\u2019t like the idea of receiving an implant. However, some teeth may not be able to be saved with a root canal, which makes extraction necessary.<\/p>\n<p>Deciding on which method to pursue in order to combat your tooth decay is a decision you\u2019ll have to make after discussing your situation with our team here at American Fork Family Dentist in American Fork, Utah.
