If you are looking for hygiene products that live up to their packaging, choose products that have the ADA Seal of Acceptance. Introduced in 1931, this program is intended to help you identify oral hygiene products that are good quality, safe, and meet their marketing claims.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To receive the ADA Seal of Acceptance, a product is submitted to the ADA and its active ingredients undergo rigorous testing for safety and efficacy under strict guidelines. The presence of the Seal of Acceptance on a label proves that a product is safe for use and meets its oral health claims.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can learn more about the purpose of the ADA Seal of Acceptance in American Fork, Utah, when you call American Fork Family Dentist at 801-756-2809 and schedule a visit with our dentist, Dr. Clayton M.
