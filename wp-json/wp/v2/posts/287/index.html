For example, having something that feels like a canker sore and refuses to go away is one of the early signs. Also, you may notice lumps in the mouth, including lips and gums. White or red patches, unexplained bleeding from your mouth, bad breath, weight loss, and trouble speaking or chewing are also common symptoms. You may notice pain in the ear, a change in your voice, and also a sore throat as well.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s possible for your doctor to notice these signs during a regular examination. This is why scheduling bi-yearly visits is important, so that any symptoms can be discovered early on. Once your cleaning is completed by our team, Dr. Clayton M. Hansen will come in to inspect your mouth using a glove, specialized light, or a dye. <\/p>\n<p>Please note that just because something is found during a visit doesn\u2019t mean it is cancerous.
