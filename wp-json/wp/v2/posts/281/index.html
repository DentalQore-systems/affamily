Sometimes this can cause pressure, discomfort, or pain.<\/p>\n<p>In an instance such as this, Dr. Clayton M. Hansen offers these key insights to safely remove the object from between your teeth.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing to try is to vigorously rinse the area with lukewarm saltwater. This might help dislodge the food particle on its own. If anything, it could give you a better view of the problem.<\/p>\n<p>You should never use toothpicks or sharp, pointed tools to pry the object loose. This could injure your gums or even damage your teeth.<\/p>\n<p>Waxed dental floss is the ideal tool for clearing the object from between your teeth. The waxy coating allows the strand to slide easier between teeth to work around the foreign object. You should never force the floss into place as it could seriously injure your gums. A floss threader loaded with waxed floss might also help you work at the object from a different position.<\/p>\n<p>If you need to have a piece of food professionally extracted from between your teeth, you should call 801-756-2809 to schedule an appointment at American Fork Family Dentist. Your dentist in American Fork, Utah, will be happy to help you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"The spaces between your teeth are often tight and small, yet there are still some instances when a small piece of food or fiber can become trapped between one or two teeth.
