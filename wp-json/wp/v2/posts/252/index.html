With all of the hard, forceful objects involved, there is a high chance that you could injure your teeth, jaw, and even your gums. So, it&#8217;s best to wear a mouthguard while playing sports.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Consuming sugary products<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sugar is a harmful product that attacks your teeth and creates tooth decay. So, it&#8217;s best to avoid consuming sugary products, like candy, sweets, and soda, as much as possible. However, if you do decide to eat or drink something sugary, it&#8217;s best to properly clean your smile afterward.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Snacking all day<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Snacking all day can make your smile constantly vulnerable to the harmful substances that attack it. So, it&#8217;s best to stick to eating meals and limit snacking throughout the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Chewing on pencils<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you believe it or not, chewing on pencils can fracture your pearly whites. Over time, those fractures become bigger and thicker, resulting in major dental issues in the future. So, it&#8217;s best to avoid this habit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Smoking<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoking is a dangerous habit that needs to be avoided at all costs. If you smoke or use tobacco products, you will stain your teeth, create gum disease, or fall victim to oral cancer. If you need help quitting the habit, please ask your dentist for advice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use our tips and do your best to keep your smile in tip-top shape, then you\u2019re on your way toward reaching your smile goals!
