If one of your teeth suffers from discolored tooth enamel, chip or an old filling that no longer matched the rest of the tooth, it can stand out in your smile. Many people in the American Fork, Utah area with a tooth like this will reach out to Dr. Clayton M. Hansen to explore their options for improving their smile\u2019s appearance.<\/p>\n<p>One of the most effective methods to cosmetically enhance an unappealing tooth is to have Dr. Clayton M. Hansen restore it with a porcelain crown. This is a relatively common dental restoration, where Dr. Clayton M. Hansen will remove the entire tooth enamel layer. This leaves behind a dentin abutment that will eventually anchor a porcelain crown in your mouth.<\/p>\n<p>One of Dr. Clayton M. Hansen\u2019s technicians will create a detailed impression of the area. This will be sent to a dental lab, where your new crown will be cast from a special dental-grade porcelain. A temporary crown is then secured over the abutment to protect it while you await completion of your crown.<\/p>\n<p>A member of Dr. Clayton M. Hansen\u2019s staff will call you in for a brief follow-up appointment when the porcelain crown is ready. The temporary crown will then be removed and the porcelain replacement will be cemented onto the abutment with a dental-grade adhesive<\/p>\n<p>If you live in the American Fork, Utah area and you need to have an unappealing tooth in your smile, you should call 801-756-2809 to set up a consultation with Dr. Clayton M. Hansen. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"A smile full of white teeth can give an extra edge to your self-confidence.
